    <center> <h2>I’m lost in a world with 7.4 billion people just as misplaced as I am. I ask myself frequently, what can I do? I want to find anything that can help me find my place. More importantly, I want to help positively affect others. Once I realized this, I burst out looking for opportunities to help. I searched for ways to help individuals, my peers, and my community as a whole. Student Council is what initially sparked my interest in helping improve my school. I learned various skills throughout my years in the organization. I got to spend time with like-minded people that were dedicated to improving our school’s community. Every year, we made  improvements. For example, my junior year, I was part of a team that helped plan winter formal. The tickets sold out faster than any other year at Lawndale High School. We experienced similar success with our homecoming sales, and I was lucky enough to experience this as President of Student Council.
Helping sell tickets for a school dance defined my role in my school’s community for multiple reasons. Not only did I help create memories that students will cherish, but our student government used these funds to help improve our school’s environment. We pushed for a cleaner campus by awarding prizes to clubs that helped clean up trash on campus. My fellow students and I have also helped improve campus involvement by encouraging the emergence of new clubs and holding involvement fairs to ensure student participation. These clubs also contribute to the improving our campus, allowing Student Council to have a widespread effect while successfully creating change.  
I hold a leadership role in many of these clubs, allowing me to personally encourage my peers to get involved.As treasurer of Key Club and AVID, I am a part of a group of students that commemorates members for their hard work. In doing so, these clubs encourage others to act as model students. As a result, other students are inspired to contribute to the school community as well.
